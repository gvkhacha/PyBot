  * Write your code!

To find a way to contribute, visit the project tied to this repo. Your guideline to understanding the project will be under the 'Project' heading down below!

### Local Testing
To make sure your contributions work before pushing them onto the life repository, make sure you test on a private server/Discord development mode.

To be able to run the files, make sure you use Python 3.6 and [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite). You may use Python virtual environments with [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv), as Pipfiles have been provided.

```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
python bot.py
```

If you wish to install the modules using pip/PyPi, use the following:
  * discord-rewrite
  * yarl<1.2


To create a Discord Application for this bot, head over to [Discord Developer's Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and create an application, and a bot. From there, copy the bot's token and save it to a file called token.txt in the main directory. You can use OAuth found under the Application to add the bot to a server. 


### Project
  The project hosts 3 columns:
   * Needs Learner - Any items under this section are up for grabs. These will include features to be added in, bug fixes, etc.
      * To claim something from this section, please navigate to the Issues tab in the repo. Once there find the item you wanted to work on and post a comment that you'd like to work on it. A repo maintainer will then move that item to the in progress section with your name included as well as assign you to the issue

   * In Progress - Any items here are currently in progress. The name of the user working on the feature, bug, etc will be included.

   * Completed - Completed items will go here with the name of the user!

# Closer
  All help is greatly appreciated and we really hope everybody can learn atleast something from this project. The goal is to allow all interested users to contribute in one way or another. The repo will not be dominated by only a couple contributors while others watch wishing they got a chance as well. We're all here to learn and work together!
